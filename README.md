# iOS App using SwiftUI

iOS Project implemented with SwiftUI and Core Data.

## Approach:
Working on a simple way to achieve this task is by working with SwiftUI files as a ViewModel. Also wanted to add ViewModels but in order to do that I need to understand more about how to interact between layers, as well as add Unit Testing.

## To run:
Open .xcproject and comand+shift+r to run.

## Missing specs
In order to create push notifications and iCloud I need to create a paid account (I don't have one).

## Requirements
* Xcode Version 15.0+  Swift 5.0+
